culmus (0.101-7) unstable; urgency=low

  The culmus package moved its config in /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ with a link
  from /etc/fonts/conf.d/
  If you are upgrading your package we will not touch your current
  configuration, you can remove the file /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-culmus.conf
  and create a link for 65-culmus.conf with the command:
  ln -s ../conf.avail/65-culmus.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/65-culmus.conf
